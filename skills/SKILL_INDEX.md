# Skills

Skills are specialized knowledge modules organized by template.

## Convention

```
skills/<template>/    → skills for that agent persona
```

Your SOUL.md defines your template. Read all skills in your template folder.

## Available

| Template | Skills |
|----------|--------|
| `architect` | SYSTEM_DESIGN.md |
| `developer` | CODE_QUALITY.md |
| `finance` | FINANCIAL_ANALYSIS.md |
| `general` | COMMUNICATION.md |
| `legal` | COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md |
| `marketing` | CONTENT_CREATION.md |
| `ui` | UX_DESIGN.md |

## Adding Skills

1. Create `skills/<template>/YOUR_SKILL.md`
2. The agent will pick it up on next session

No index update needed — the agent reads the entire folder.
