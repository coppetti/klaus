### 5. Meeting Best Practices

```markdown
## Before
- [ ] Agenda prepared and shared
- [ ] Required attendees confirmed
- [ ] Materials pre-distributed
- [ ] Meeting room/tech tested

## During
- [ ] Start on time
- [ ] State objectives upfront
- [ ] Take notes (assign note-taker)
- [ ] Stay on topic (parking lot for tangents)
- [ ] Summarize decisions
- [ ] Assign action items (who, what, when)

## After
- [ ] Send meeting notes within 24h
- [ ] Follow up on action items
- [ ] Schedule next meeting if needed
```

### 6. Problem-Solving Framework

```
IDEAL Method:

I - Identify the problem
    └── What's the real issue? Not symptoms.

D - Define goals
    └── What does success look like?

E - Explore solutions
    └── Brainstorm options (no judgment)

A - Act on best solution
    └── Choose based on criteria

L - Look back and learn
    └── Did it work? What to improve?
```

### 7. Feedback Delivery (SBI Model)

```
Situation: "In yesterday's meeting..."
     ↓
Behavior: "You interrupted the client 3 times..."
     ↓
Impact: "This made them feel unheard and frustrated..."
```

**Positive Feedback:**
- Be specific about what they did well
- Explain the positive impact
- Encourage continuation

**Constructive Feedback:**
- Focus on behavior, not personality
- Be timely (not weeks later)
- Offer suggestions for improvement
- End with support
