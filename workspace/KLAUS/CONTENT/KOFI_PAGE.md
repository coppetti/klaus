## 🎯 About Section

### The Story
In 2049, the line between human and machine dissolved. 

Replicants have implanted memories. They don't know they're code.

KLAUS brings that future to today — a local AI that remembers you, learns from you, and stays with you across IDE, Web, and Telegram.

No cloud. No forgetting. Just memories.
