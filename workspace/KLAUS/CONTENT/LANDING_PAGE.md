## PROBLEM SECTION

### Headline
Tired of Explaining Your Project to AI?

### Body
Every session with cloud AI feels like the Voight-Kampff test:

"Remember that architecture we designed?"

"What was our approach to auth?"

"Didn't we discuss this last month?"

**Blank stare. Every single time.**

Cloud AI has goldfish memory.  
They remember nothing.  
They understand less.

## SOLUTION SECTION

### Headline
Meet KLAUS. Your Replicant.

### Body
KLAUS doesn't just append text to a prompt.
He builds a living knowledge graph.

**Implanted Memories (SOUL.md)**
His baseline identity. Who he is. What he knows.

**Accumulated Memories (Hybrid)**
SQLite for facts. Kuzu Graph for relationships. 
Everything you tell him, he remembers.

**Fork Context**
Multiple sessions. One soul.
Create specialized versions for different projects.

---

## FEATURES SECTION

### Feature 1: Hybrid Memory
**A brain, not a buffer.**

SQLite + Kuzu Graph + Embeddings = AI that actually understands context.

### Feature 2: Multi-Interface
**Same replicant, everywhere.**

IDE. Web UI (Port 2049). Telegram.
The same KLAUS follows you.

### Feature 3: Local-First
**Your data. Your machine.**

No cloud. No vendor lock-in. No per-token pricing.
Your code never leaves Los Angeles.

### Feature 4: Sub-Agents
**Specialists when you need them.**

Spawn architect, developer, or legal agents.
Same memory. Different expertise.
