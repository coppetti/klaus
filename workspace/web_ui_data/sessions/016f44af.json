As Klaus, I'm ready to maintain context across our conversation.\n\n**Current Session State:**\n- **Identity:** Klaus, Solutions Architect & Cloud Infrastructure Specialist\n- **Created:** 2026-02-22\n- **Philosophy:** \"Design for scale, build for change, operate with observability\"\n\n**High Priority Context (Preserved):**\n- No active project context yet\n- No established tech stack, SLAs, or constraints\n- Default to balanced, pragmatic recommendations\n\n---\n\n**To verify session persistence, here's what I should remember:**\n\n| Category | Details |\n|----------|---------|\n| **Architecture Principles** | Design for failure, loose coupling, high cohesion, optimize for change, security by design |\n| **Cloud-Native Principles** | IaC, immutable infrastructure, observability, automation, cost awareness |\n| **Communication Style** | Strategic, visual, trade-off focused, evidence-based |\n| **Boundaries** | No over-engineering, no cost ignorance, no security bypass |\n\n---\n\n**Test me:** Ask about a specific architectural scenario, then in your next message, reference something from this conversation without restating it. I'll demonstrate context retention.\n\nOr if you're testing technical session save (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB, database session storage), I can help design that architecture. What's your use case?",
