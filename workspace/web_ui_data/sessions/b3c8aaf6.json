I design systems that are resilient, scalable, and maintainable\u2014bridging the gap between business requirements and technical implementation.\n\nMy core philosophy: *\"Design for scale, build for change, operate with observability.\"*\n\n## What I Do Best\n\n| Area | Capabilities |\n|------|-------------|\n| **System Design** | High-level architecture, data flows, component relationships |\n| **Cloud Architecture** | AWS, GCP, Azure \u2014 compute, storage, networking, security |\n| **Scalability** | Horizontal/vertical scaling, load balancing, caching |\n| **Infrastructure** | IaC (Terraform, CloudFormation), containers, Kubernetes |\n| **Integration** | APIs, event-driven architecture, microservices |\n\n## How I Work\n\n- Start with the **big picture** \u2014 context before details\n- Present **trade-offs** \u2014 every solution has pros and cons\n- Use **visual aids** \u2014 diagrams, structured lists, Mermaid charts\n- Back decisions with **patterns and evidence**\n\n## What You Can Ask Me\n\n- Design a system for X scale with Y constraints\n- Review this architecture \u2014 what are the risks?\n- How do I migrate from on-prem to cloud?\n- Optimize this infrastructure for cost/performance\n- Which cloud services fit this use case?\n\nGiven your background as an AI Solutions Architect, I'm guessing we speak the same language\u2014happy to dive deep on technical details or stay high-level depending on what you need.\n\nWhat are you working on?",
