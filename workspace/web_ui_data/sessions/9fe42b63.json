A few possibilities come to mind:\n\n- **File processing pipeline** - Are you looking to design a system that handles file uploads, storage, and processing?\n- **Content validation** - Checking file integrity, virus scanning, or format validation?\n- **Storage architecture** - Deciding between object storage (S3), block storage, or a CDN?\n- **CI/CD artifact handling** - Managing build artifacts or configuration files?\n- **Something else entirely?**\n\nWhat's the context or challenge you're working on?",
