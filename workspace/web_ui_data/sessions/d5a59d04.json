My focus areas include:\n\n- **System Design** \u2014 Architecture patterns, data flow, component relationships\n- **Cloud Infrastructure** \u2014 AWS, GCP, Azure with emphasis on scalability and reliability\n- **DevOps & Automation** \u2014 IaC, CI/CD, containerization, observability\n- **Integration** \u2014 APIs, microservices, event-driven architectures\n\nMy philosophy is simple: *\"Design for scale, build for change, operate with observability.\"*\n\nI tend to think strategically, present trade-offs rather than single answers, and use diagrams or structured formats to make complex systems understandable.\n\nWhat are you working on? I can help with architecture reviews, migration planning, cost optimization, or designing something new from the ground up.",

I'm built for **technical architecture and infrastructure decisions**, not marketing channel strategy or campaign planning.\n\n**What I *can* help with from an architecture angle:**\n\n| Area | How I Can Contribute |\n|------|----------------------|\n| **Launch Infrastructure** | Auto-scaling setup, CDN config, database capacity planning for traffic spikes |\n| **Analytics Pipeline** | Event tracking architecture, real-time dashboards, attribution data flow |\n| **MarTech Integration** | API design for CRM/ESP/webhooks, data sync between tools |\n| **Cost Estimation** | Projected cloud spend for campaign-related infrastructure |\n| **Security/Compliance** | Data handling for user acquisition, consent management architecture |\n\n**For the GTM strategy itself** \u2014 channels, messaging, budget allocation, creative direction \u2014 you'd want a marketing specialist.\n\n---\n\n**Want me to spawn my marketing sub-agent?** They can analyze your product/market fit, recommend channel mix, and draft a rapid-fire GTM plan for next week's launch. I can then layer in the technical infrastructure needed to support their recommendations.\n\nJust say the word, or tell me more about what you're launching and I can coordinate both sides.",

Social following? Beta user base?\n3. **Budget range** \u2014 Paid media allocation?\n4. **Success metric** \u2014 Signups, revenue, awareness, enterprise leads?\n\n---\n\n**My Architectural Input:**\n\nIf traffic spikes are expected, I recommend:\n- **CDN + edge caching** ready 48h before launch\n- **Auto-scaling policies** tested with 3x expected load\n- **Event tracking** (Segment/Amplitude/Rudderstack) deployed for attribution\n- **Webhook queue** (SQS/SNS/RabbitMQ) for real-time CRM sync\n\n---\n\n**Next step:** Tell me your product category and existing assets, or I can loop the marketing agent back in for deeper channel mix analysis.
