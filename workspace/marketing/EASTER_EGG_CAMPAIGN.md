# 🥚 Easter Egg Campaign: The Port Numbers

## The Concept

Every port tells a story. For those paying attention, the numbers **2013/2077** aren't random—they're a secret handshake with the developer community.

---

## 🎮 The Ports: 2013 / 2077

### The Story
- **2013**: Year the Cyberpunk RPG was released (the original tabletop game)
- **2077**: Year of Cyberpunk 2077 (the famous video game)
- **Together**: A bridge between analog and digital, between past vision and future reality

### Why This Fits Klaus
- **Cyberpunk themes**: AI, memory, augmentation, the blurred line between human and machine
- **Developer culture**: Gaming references resonate with developers
- **Nostalgia + Future**: Like Klaus itself—learning from the past (memory) to build the future

---

## 📝 Campaign Integration

### Phase 1: The Tease (Subtle)

**Twitter Post 1:**
```
Building Klaus in 2026.
But our ports remember 2013 → 2077.

Some will understand.

Tuesday. 9am EST.

🧙‍♂️🎮
```

**Twitter Post 2:**
```
Klaus runs on ports 2013/2077.

If you know, you know.
If you don't... Tuesday you'll find out.

#Cyberpunk #AI #Klaus
```

### Phase 2: The Reveal (Launch Day)

**Twitter Thread Addition:**
```
6/ Hidden details:

Klaus runs on ports 2013/2077.

Why? Because like Cyberpunk, we believe in:
→ High tech, low life (simple setup, powerful results)
→ Augmentation (AI enhancing humans, not replacing)
→ Memory that persists (just like the game's themes)

Also, we're nerds. 🤓
```

**LinkedIn Post Addition:**
```
**Easter Eggs for the Observant**

If you look at Klaus's configuration, you'll notice something:
- Port 2013 (Cyberpunk RPG release year)
- Port 2077 (Cyberpunk game setting)

Why? Because Klaus is built by developers who:
→ Love gaming culture
→ Believe in Easter eggs
→ Think attention to detail matters

The ports aren't random. They're a secret handshake.

For everyone who noticed: you're our people. 🎮
```

### Phase 3: Community Engagement

**Tweet:**
```
First person to screenshot their browser on http://localhost:2077 with Klaus running gets a special shoutout in our README.

Tag us. 📸
```

**Tweet:**
```
Fun fact: We almost used port 4242 (Hitchhiker's Guide) but 2013/2077 felt more "Klaus vibes"—analog memory meeting digital future.

What port would YOU have chosen?

4242? 1337? 8008? 😏
```

1. **Exclusivity**: Only those "in the know" understand immediately
2. **Shareability**: Creates "I found this" moments people want to share
3. **Personality**: Shows Klaus isn't just corporate software—it's made by humans who love culture
4. **Memorability**: Port numbers become a story, not just config

**The narrative:**
"Klaus isn't just another AI tool. It's built by developers who care about details, who respect culture, who believe software should have soul."

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Decide final ports**: 2013/2077 vs 4242/4243 vs 2049/2099
2. **Update all configs**: docker-compose.yml, .env.example, docs
3. **Create visual assets**: Cyberpunk-style banners
4. **Write reveal content**: Launch day tweets/posts
5. **Plan community challenges**: Engagement strategy

---

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Go with 2013/2077.**

Why over 4242/4243?
- More visually distinct (20xx vs 42xx)
- Stronger visual identity for marketing
- Cyberpunk aesthetic aligns better with "AI future" narrative
- 2013 → 2077 tells a progression story (past to future)

**The tagline:**
> "Built in 2026. Remembering 2013. Dreaming of 2077."
