## Phase 1: Teasers (Days -7 to -1)

### Tweet 1 (Day -7): The Problem
```
Current AI assistants are like goldfish.

5 minutes of conversation?
Poof. Context gone.

What if your AI actually remembered your projects?

Building something different.

Launching soon 🧙
```
**Time:** 9:00 AM EST
**Media:** None (text only hits harder)

---

### Tweet 2 (Day -5): Multi-Agent Tease
```
I don't want ONE AI assistant.

I want a team of specialists:
→ Developer for code review
→ Architect for system design
→ Marketing for launch copy
→ Legal for compliance

All sharing the same memory.

All working together.

Coming 🔜
```
**Time:** 10:00 AM EST

### Tweet 3 (Day -3): Architecture Tease
```
Most AI "memory" is just:
1. Dump chat history
2. Hope it fits
3. Watch it degrade

Not memory. That's a sticky note.

True memory = Knowledge graph + Fast lookups + Intelligent consolidation

Building the brain AI deserves 🧠
```
**Time:** 2:00 PM EST
**Media:** Simple diagram (optional)

### Tweet 6 (Launch Day - Thread 1/5): The Problem
```
1/ Why I built Klaus:

Every AI conversation starts the same:

"Remember that payment system we designed?"
"What was our approach to auth?"
"Can you review this like last week?"

It's exhausting.
```
**Time:** 9:05 AM EST (reply to Tweet 5)

---

### Tweet 7 (Launch Day - Thread 2/5): The Solution
```
2/ So I built something with real memory.

Not "conversation history."

A living knowledge graph that understands:
→ Your coding style
→ Your architecture patterns
→ Your project relationships
→ Your preferences

It learns. Like a teammate.
```
**Time:** 9:10 AM EST (reply to Tweet 6)

---

### Tweet 8 (Launch Day - Thread 3/5): Multi-Agent
```
3/ But one brain isn't enough.

So Klaus auto-spawns specialists:

"Review this code" → Developer Agent 🧑‍💻
"Design this system" → Architect Agent 🏗️
"Is this legal?" → Legal Agent ⚖️
"Marketing strategy" → Marketing Agent 📈

Same memory. Different expertise.
```
**Time:** 9:15 AM EST (reply to Tweet 7)

---

### Tweet 9 (Launch Day - Thread 4/5): Technical
```
4/ How it works:

Hybrid Memory Architecture:
• SQLite = Fast facts (episodic)
• Kuzu Graph = Knowledge relationships (semantic)

Auto-consolidation
Context compaction
Session forking (Git branches for AI!)

All open source.
```
**Time:** 9:20 AM EST (reply to Tweet 8)
**Media:** Architecture diagram

## Phase 3: Post-Launch (Days 1-30)

### Tweet 13 (Day 3): Feature Spotlight
```
One of my favorite Klaus features:

Session Forking 🍴

Stuck on a problem? Fork the conversation.
Try a different approach with a specialist agent.

Works? Merge insights back.
Doesn't? Delete the fork.

Like Git branches, but for AI conversations.

### Tweet 15 (Day 14): Tip/Trick
```
Klaus Tip 💡

Type "consolidate" anytime to trigger memory consolidation.

Klaus will:
1. Extract key learnings
2. Update the knowledge graph
3. Prune low-value noise

Your AI gets smarter while you work.
