# LinkedIn Post 5/5: Klaus is Open Source 🎉

**Hook:** I built an AI team lead. Now you can use it too.

---

After 3 months of building, testing, and using Klaus daily:

→ 7 specialized agents
→ Hybrid memory system (SQLite + Graph)
→ Multi-provider LLM support
→ Web UI + Telegram bot
→ Full test suite

**It's ready. And it's open source.**

---

**What you get:**

✅ An AI that remembers your projects (not just conversations)
✅ Auto-spawning specialists (Developer, Finance, Legal, Marketing, UI, Architect)
✅ Visual memory graph explorer
✅ Session forking (like Git branches for conversations)
✅ Context compaction (smart pruning, not truncation)
✅ Bring your own LLM (Kimi, Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, OpenRouter)
✅ Web UI + Telegram integration
✅ Docker setup (one command to run)
✅ Cross-platform installers (GUI + CLI)

---

**Try it in 60 seconds:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coppetti/klaus/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or GUI installer:
```bash
python installer/install_gui.py
```

Then open http://localhost:7072

---

**Who is this for?**

→ Solo developers who need a team
→ Tech leads managing multiple projects  
→ Consultants switching between client contexts
→ Anyone tired of explaining their project to AI repeatedly

**Who is this NOT for?**

→ People who want a simple chatbot
→ Those who prefer cloud-only solutions (Klaus runs locally by default)
→ Users who don't want to configure anything (there's setup, but it's guided)

---

**My ask:**

If Klaus sounds interesting:
1. Try it (feedback welcome!)
2. Star the repo ⭐
3. Share this post with someone who needs it

If you find bugs (there will be bugs), open an issue.

If you want to contribute (new agent templates, integrations), PRs welcome.

**Why open source?**

Because I believe AI assistants should be:
→ Transparent (you see how memory works)
→ Controllable (you own your data)
→ Extensible (build your own agents)

Not a black box that forgets you exist after logout.

---

**What's next for Klaus?**

→ VS Code extension (deep IDE integration)
→ More agent templates (DevOps, Security, Data Science)
→ Memory import/export (port your knowledge between instances)
→ Team collaboration (shared memory spaces)

But first, I want to hear from YOU.

What would you build with an AI that actually remembers?
