# 🚀 Klaus Launch Master Plan

**The complete strategy for launching Klaus successfully.**

---

## 📋 Overview

**Product:** Klaus - Multi-Agent AI with Hybrid Memory  
**Model:** Free & Open Source + GitHub Sponsors + Ko-fi  
**Duration:** 30-day launch campaign  
**Goal:** 500+ GitHub stars, sustainable community

---

## 🎯 Core Strategy

### Philosophy
> "Give first, receive later"

Klaus is **completely free**. No paywall, no limits, no tricks.

Revenue comes from:
- People who love it and want to support (donations)
- Future "Pro" tier (cloud hosting, team features)

### Why This Works
1. **Trust** - Users can try before any commitment
2. **Adoption** - Zero barrier = more users
3. **Community** - Contributors can send PRs
4. **Visibility** - Public repos get GitHub trending
5. **Goodwill** - People support projects they love

→ Add "Sponsorships coming soon" note
→ Apply pressure: nothing breaks

### If Something Breaks
→ Acknowledge immediately ("We're fixing it!")
→ Pin issue on GitHub
→ Keep engaging, be transparent
→ Fix fast, update everyone

### If Low Engagement
→ Don't panic (launches are marathons)
→ Keep posting consistently
→ Engage more with others' content
→ Try different communities
→ Iterate on messaging
