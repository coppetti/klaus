## Quick Reply Templates

### Common Questions

**"Is it free?"**
> Yes! Klaus is 100% free and open source. If you find it valuable, you can sponsor development via GitHub Sponsors or Ko-fi, but there's no obligation.

**"Does it work with [X] LLM?"**
> Klaus supports Kimi, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and OpenRouter. You can even use local models via Ollama!

**"How is this different from ChatGPT?"**
> Klaus remembers your projects across sessions (Hybrid Memory), auto-spawns specialist agents, and runs locally. It's more like a teammate than a chatbot.

**"Can I self-host?"**
> Yes! That's the default mode. Docker Compose setup takes 5 minutes.

**"Found a bug"**
> Thank you! Please open an issue on GitHub with details: https://github.com/coppetti/klaus/issues
