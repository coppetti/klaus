# LinkedIn Post 1/5: The Spark 🔥

**Hook:** I was tired of AI assistants that forget everything after 5 minutes.

---

Every time I started a new coding session with ChatGPT, I had to re-explain my project structure, my preferences, my architecture decisions... 

"Remember that microservice we designed yesterday?"
"Can you review this code like you did last week?"

It felt like talking to a goldfish. 🐠

So I built something different.

Meet **Klaus** — an AI that actually remembers.

Not just "conversation history" (which everyone has). I'm talking about:

→ Understanding that you're working on a payment system, so when you ask about "security," it knows you mean PCI compliance, not a login form
→ Remembering you prefer functional programming over OOP
→ Recalling that last month you refactored the auth layer, so when you mention "bugs," it checks there first

The difference?

**Hybrid Memory Architecture**: Fast SQLite lookups + Semantic Knowledge Graph (Kuzu)

Instead of just appending text to a prompt, Klaus builds a living knowledge graph of your projects, preferences, and decisions.

It's like having a senior developer who's been on your team for years — not a new intern every day.

Want to see how it works? Code is open source (link in comments 👇)

Drop a 🔥 if you're also tired of explaining your project to AI for the 100th time.
