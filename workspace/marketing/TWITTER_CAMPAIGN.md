#AI #OpenSource #BuildInPublic

Thread 🧵👇
```

#### Post 6 - 9:05am (Thread 1/5)
```
1/ The Problem:

Every AI conversation starts the same:

"Remember that payment system?"
"What was our auth approach?"

Exhausting.

Klaus builds a living knowledge graph.

It learns. Like a teammate.
```

#### Post 7 - 9:10am (Thread 2/5)
```
2/ Multi-Agent Magic:

"Review this code" → Developer Agent 🧑‍💻
"Design this system" → Architect Agent 🏗️
"Is this legal?" → Legal Agent ⚖️

Same memory. Different expertise.

One orchestrator. Infinite specialists.
```

#### Post 8 - 9:15am (Thread 3/5)
```
3/ Hybrid Memory:

Most AI "memory" is chat history.
That's a sticky note.

Klaus uses:
• SQLite for fast facts
• Kuzu Graph for relationships
• Auto-consolidation
• Context compaction

A brain, not a buffer.
```

#### Post 9 - 9:20am (Thread 4/5)
```
4/ Built for developers:

→ Session forking (Git branches for AI)
→ Visual memory explorer
→ Bring your own LLM
→ Self-hosted by default
→ No vendor lock-in

Your data. Your control.
```

#### Post 10 - 9:25am (Thread 5/5 + CTA)
```
5/ Free. Open Source. Forever.

### Post-Launch Week (March 5-9)

#### Wednesday (March 5)
**Post 14 - 9am:** Technical deep dive
```
How Klaus memory actually works:

1. User sends message
2. Extract entities & relationships
3. Update SQLite (fast lookup)
4. Update Kuzu Graph (semantic)
5. Consolidate periodically

Result: AI that knows your context.

github.com/coppetti/klaus
```

**Post 15 - 3pm:** Use case
```
Real scenario:

"Design a microservices architecture for payments"

Klaus spawns Architect Agent.
Analyzes your stack (from memory).
Suggests patterns you prefer.
Explains trade-offs.

Context-aware AI.

github.com/coppetti/klaus
```

#### Thursday (March 6)
**Post 16 - 9am:** Comparison
```
ChatGPT: "I don't remember our previous conversations"

Claude: "I have limited context window"

Klaus: "You prefer microservices over monoliths, use PostgreSQL, and had issues with the auth module last month. Want me to check there first?"

Memory matters.

github.com/coppetti/klaus
```

**Post 17 - 3pm:** Behind the scenes
```
Built with:
• FastAPI (web)
• SQLite + Kuzu (memory)
• Docker (deployment)
