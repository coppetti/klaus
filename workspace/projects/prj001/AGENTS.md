## Next Steps

To initialize this project, consider:

1. **Choose a technology stack** based on project requirements:
   - Python: Initialize with `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`
   - JavaScript/TypeScript: Initialize with `package.json`
   - Rust: Initialize with `Cargo.toml`
   - Go: Initialize with `go.mod`
   - Other: Use appropriate project initialization tools

2. **Set up the basic project structure** with source directories, tests, and documentation.

3. **Configure development tools** such as:
   - Linter and formatter (e.g., Ruff, ESLint, Prettier, rustfmt)
   - Type checker (if applicable)
   - Testing framework
   - CI/CD pipeline

4. **Update this `AGENTS.md` file** once the project is initialized to document the actual architecture and conventions.
